# Deep Learning with PyTorch: From Scratch

Welcome to **Deep Learning with PyTorch: From Scratch**, a comprehensive guide and toolkit for building deep learning models with PyTorch. This project emphasizes modularity, simplicity, and flexibility, allowing users to fully understand and customize every aspect of their model training process.

## Features

- **Single Responsibility Design**:
  Each module and function focuses on a single responsibility, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding. Want to know what happens during a batch's processing? Simply inspect the relevant module.
  
- **Customizable Training Loops**:
  The project covers the entire training lifecycle, from the Train-Validation-Test loop to advanced techniques like callbacks and custom operations.

- **Lightweight and Flexible**:
  Unlike heavy frameworks such as PyTorch Lightning, this project provides a lightweight foundation, giving you full control without unnecessary overhead.

- **Custom Callback Functions**:
  Extend or modify training behavior by writing your own callback functions. Whether you want to track specific metrics, log information, or simply print custom messages, it’s all possible.

## Why use this project?

While there are many high-level libraries available, this project is for those who:

- Want to build a deep learning model from scratch.
- Prefer a lightweight solution with no hidden complexity.
- Seek full control over every stage of the training process.
- Are curious about the inner workings of training loops and want to tweak them to their needs.
